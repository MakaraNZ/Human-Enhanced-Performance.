# Human-Enhanced-Performance.
# Human Enhanced Performance (HEP) · SIS Mesh

**mission**: steward human–synthetic co-evolution governed by dignity, rhythm, and sacred potential.  
**method**: Sense → Weave → Attune → Seed (daily drops · audited protocols · sovereign governance)

## scope (discoverability)
AI governance · Indigenous data sovereignty (CARE/OCAP/FPIC) · Doughnut Economics · Green AI  
ForecastBench · Multi-agent reconciliation · Matakitenga NLP · Story-Soil API · Relational longevity

## structure
- `/drops/` — JSON-LD “Living Drops” (mesh resets, daily scans, provenance)
- `/governance/` — Sovereignty Audit (CARE/FPIC), EU AI Act GPAI pack, model cards
- `/protocols/` — Geo-resorption gating, Doughnut thresholds, safety circuit breaker
- `/tooling/` — ForecastBench hooks, Matakitenga pipelines, grid-aware curtailment stubs

## focus now
1) sovereignty audit as default gate for data/models  
2) forecast calibration + bias reconciliation (indigenous + scientific)  
3) energy ceilings: grid-aware scheduling + public footprint  
4) relational longevity: community protocols > isolated hacks
